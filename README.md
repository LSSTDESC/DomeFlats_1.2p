# DomeFlats_1.2p

2018-07-05, Robert Lupton: You wouldn't usually bother, just take enough flats that the counts were 100\* the sky (so 50\* or 200\* wouldn't be important!).   We can probably use 10\*sky, or a 5% loss in SN.  Maybe 5\*sky (10%).  I did that right, didn't I?

2018-07-06, Jim Chiang: ok, here are e-/pixel values (assuming 0.2"x0.2" pixels) for two locations on the sky, one at the center of the full protoDC2 region (WFD_center) and the other at the center of the uDDF region, integrated over all of the Run1.2p visits:

```
band   WFD_center   uDDF_center
 u            975         17960
 g           6738        268346
 r          34578        222485
 i          43131        167237
 z          54132        209513
 y          54756        236889
 ```
